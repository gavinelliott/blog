2 years ago I started my first day working at the [Department for Work and Pensions](https://dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/). It's been a wild ride with no sign it's slowing down.

I'm enjoying every minute.

For the first 10 days of my time in the department, I made a point of posting some thoughts and observations in the form of a tweet per day. I kept them and thought this was a better time than any to take a look back.

**Day 1:** 1st Day was great, topped off by catching up with [@csswizardry](https://twitter.com/csswizardry) over Thai food.

**Day 2:** 2nd day at @DigitalDWP, there's a tremendous amount of people that really care and strive to make a real difference for users.

**Day 3:** There are no ego's in Government Design teams, everyone cares and shares. #ofthegovernment

**Day 4:** The need to make Gov Services better doesn't stop with Designers. User Researchers, Product Owners, FED's and more work in cohesion.

**Day 5:** Proud of working as part of a multidisciplinary team who aren't just passionate but they're emotionally invested. #ofthegovernment

**Day 6:** Iterate. #ofthegovernment

**Day 7:** You can't set an assumption in stone unless you've done your research on it. It's also ok to have assumptions.

**Day 8:** It's not just your team and service, Government Digital teams communicate A LOT to build a better digital service. #ofthegovernment

**Day 9:** No matter how simple \*you\* think something is, user research will always inform you of a reality. #ofthegovernment

**Day 10:** Proper design challenges, stuff that matters. #ofthegovernment

### To sum it up

Day 10 sums it all up. I'm two years in and we still have 'proper' design challenges on 'stuff' that really matters. More now than ever.

There's a lot of hard work ahead of us. We're only just getting started.
