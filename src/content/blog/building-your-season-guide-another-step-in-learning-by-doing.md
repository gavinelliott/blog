title: 'Building Your Season Guide: Another step in learning by doing'
description: 'How building Your Season Guide continued my journey of learning by doing, prototyping in code and making the gap between idea and execution smaller than ever.'

A few weeks back I wrote about why prototyping in code beats everything else. About how real feedback comes from real interactions. How you only start to understand what works when something lives in a browser, not in a design file.

Your Season Guide is one of the things I built on that premise.

I didn't build [Your Season Guide](https://yourseasonguide.com) because I'm a colour analysis expert. I built it because I had a conversation with Ange she said, "I'd love an app that could tell me which colours suit me." And instead of nodding and moving on, I said, "I could probably make that."

That moment where you believe you might actually be able to build something. That's everything.

So I gave it a go. Just like I did with Best AI Things. Just like I've done with every product I've launched over the last few months like [CleanReader](https://gavinelliott.co.uk/blog/building-cleanreader-one-click-to-better-reading/). These projects aren't big bets. They're small focused experiments designed to teach me something new. To test how far [agentic coding](https://gavinelliott.co.uk/blog/getting-into-agentic-coding/) can go. To learn by doing.

## A mix of form and function

[Your Season Guide](https://yourseasonguide.com) offers two paths. One's free. You choose your features manually and it gives you a seasonal colour match. The other's premium. You upload a photo and the app analyses it to provide a more advanced report. Shades, colour harmony, styling advice and more.

It's all browser-based. It's private. It doesn't track or store personal data. And it looks good doing it. That mattered to me. I wanted it to feel light, simple and helpful. Not another bloated app with six steps before you see any value.

It uses all the modern stuff. Next.js, Tailwind, Clerk, Stripe, Supabase, Drizzle and Resend. But more importantly, it was another example of what happens when you remove blockers and just start making.

## Just enough

The product isn't perfect. There are parts I want to improve. Things I'd do differently next time. But that's not the point. The point is I built something real. Something people can use. Something I learned from.

And it actually works! I've field-tested it, seen people use it and be surprised about how good it is. 

And that's what I keep coming back to. The learning. Every product I build teaches me something. Not just about tech stacks or state management but about ideas, assumptions and how I work. It builds confidence. Builds momentum. And it makes the next thing feel more possible.

## The pattern

There's a pattern to all this now. Something sparks an idea. I sketch it in my head. I open Cursor. I start prompting. I get a prototype in the browser. I test it. I tweak it. I refine it. I launch it. And I learn.

That pattern. That rhythm. Has changed how I think about what's possible. And it's made the gap between idea and execution feel smaller than ever.

[Your Season Guide](https://yourseasonguide.com) wasn't the goal. Learning was. Making was. And that's why it exists.
