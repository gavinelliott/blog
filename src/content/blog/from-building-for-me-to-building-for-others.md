The last few months have been an ongoing loop of building, testing and learning. Small ideas, prototypes, then seeing how far I could take them. [CV Anywhere](https://cvanywhere.com) is the next step in that pattern, but it's the first that's really about helping other people get something done.

It started like most of my projects do. I saw a problem. I got frustrated. I thought, "Surely this could be better." And instead of letting it go, I opened Cursor and started typing.

The problem? CVs or Resumes.

More specifically, the experience of managing, updating, sharing and tailoring a CV in 2025. It's painful. It's either a Word doc that's impossible to format or a PDF that never feels quite right. The moment you want to tweak it for a new role, the formatting breaks, you lose the plot and end up reverting back to whatever version you last emailed someone.

So I built something better. CV Anywhere takes your traditional CV and turns it into a clean, shareable, responsive webpage. Something that works across devices. Something that doesn't fall apart when you edit it. Something you'd actually want to send to someone.

It's powered by AI, but in a helpful way. Not magic. Not fluff. Just practical prompts that guide you through building or improving what you've already got. It helps you structure your experience, sharpen your language and spot what's missing.

And it does the little things too. Like localised British English. Or privacy-friendly share links. Or for businesses, being able to strip out contact details if you're sharing something more publicly.

None of this was built in a week. It's taken time. Real time. But that's been the point. With every product I ship, I learn something new. Sometimes it's about a tech stack. Sometimes it's about how to write clearer onboarding. This time it was about designing something that could scale beyond just me.

CV Anywhere is live now. It's something I'm actively working on and making better each day. It works. And it helps. That's what I'm aiming for.

If you're a [job seeker](https://www.cvanywhere.com/cv-builder), [recruiter](https://www.cvanywhere.com/recruiter-friendly), [bid manager](https://www.cvanywhere.com/for-bid-management), or anyone who wants a better way to manage CVs, check out the [CV Anywhere CV Builder](https://www.cvanywhere.com/features). And if you've been thinking about building your own thing, consider this your nudge.

You don't need to wait until everything's figured out. Start small. Build real. Launch something that helps.
