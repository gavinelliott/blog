Hello you. Hello you, this is me.

That's how we started every phone call, it was our little game, one which we'd done since I was a teenager. We both used to laugh and get confused on who had to say what.

That was my Dad, my best friend.

My best friend passed away on Friday 8th January.

I never imagined what loss would feel like, but have found it is deep and reaches right down in to the pit of your soul.

It's too soon to even have many words, it's too soon to think about it, it's too soon to lose him.

I miss him, my Sister misses him, we'll always miss him.
