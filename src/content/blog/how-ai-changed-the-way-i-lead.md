When I first started using AI tools about two years ago, it wasn't to replace anything. It was about exploration, trying to understand more deeply, test faster and maybe even move a little quicker when it made sense.

I was curious. I wanted to know where AI could actually add value. Not just for me personally but for the work we do daily and more importantly how it could shape what we do in the long term.

But here's the thing about "long-term" in the middle of an AI wave: it doesn't feel long at all. Everything moves so fast that the short-term eats the long-term for breakfast. By the time you've reflected, the moment's gone. And yet, you know you'll look back in a few years and realise how big the shift really was.

From a leadership perspective, I've had to be decisive and intentional. The advice and support I give my team? It varies wildly depending on the moment. Sometimes it's "go all in." Other times it's more measured, "What problem are you actually solving here?" There's the occasional Braveheart moment, "Hold, hold, hold... nowwwwww." And sometimes it's simply, "Just stop."

That range says a lot about this space. It's variable. It's fast. The context is everything. One size never fits all.

We're in one of the most exciting periods of tech that I've seen in my lifetime. The bar keeps moving. The tempo keeps shifting. The need for versatility, nimbleness and fast iteration isn't optional. It's essential.

If I hadn't gone all in two years ago and was only now reading about what's possible with AI, I'd be worried I'd left it too late.

My advice? Don't wait.

Get hands-on. Test things. Build. Break. Learn. You don't need to be an expert. You just need to be in it. Because leading through this moment means understanding it first-hand.

That's what I'm doing. And it's changed the way I lead.
