I've been in design and product long enough to know that most people don't fail because they can't build. They fail because they don't know *what* to build.

That's especially true in the AI space right now. Everyone wants to build "something with GPT" but most of the ideas floating around are either half-baked, impossible to differentiate or just plain pointless.

So I did something about it.

## The problem I kept hearing

I'm in a lot of product and maker communities. Whether it's indie hackers, no-coders or AI devs, the same question comes up again and again:

> "I want to build with GPT, but I don't know what to build."

Not because people aren't creative, but because idea validation is hard. What sounds cool in a brainstorm often dies on contact with reality. It's either too crowded, too vague, or not useful enough to bother with.

So I sat down and built a huge database of ideas that don't suck. All of them are GPT wrapper apps. All of them are practical. And all of them are buildable today.

## What is a GPT Wrapper App?

It's exactly what it sounds like, a product that wraps a GPT model (like ChatGPT or Claude) in a focused experience for a specific use case. Think:

- A contract analyser for freelancers  
- A follow-up email generator for sales teams  
- A training summariser for HR departments  

You take one solid use case, put GPT behind it, wrap it in a clean UI and ship it. That's it.

And honestly? That's where most of the real money in AI will be made initially.

## The bundles

I packaged the ideas into three tiers:

- **Starter – 25 ideas**  
  A great entry point. Quick wins and light experiments.

- **Builder – 50 ideas**  
  For makers who want momentum and variety.

- **Ultimate – 100 ideas**  
  The full stack. Ideal for product people or micro-SaaS builders.

You can grab just the raw ideas (Basic) or go deeper with Premium, which includes:

- Competitor snapshots  
- Suggested tech stack  
- Ease of build rating  
- MVP feature list  
- Full PRD per idea (that can be used in Cursor or Replit to get you started)

Basically, I did the hard thinking so you can focus on execution.

## Who this is for

This is not for people who want to raise millions or reinvent the AI wheel.

This is for people who want to:

- Build useful, focused AI tools  
- Ship small but valuable projects  
- Get unstuck and move faster  
- Have a launchpad full of ideas that don't waste their time  

If you're that kind of person, I think you'll love these.

## What's next

I'm going to keep dropping more idea bundles. I might launch a membership or subscription later if people want it. But for now, this is lean, simple and useful.

You can check out the bundles [GPT Wrapper Apps →](https://gptwrapperapps.com)

Or just drop me a message and tell me what kind of app *you* wish someone would build. I might already have it in the vault.
