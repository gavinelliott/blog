A week ago, I launched something called GPT Wrapper App Bundles. It was a collection of pre-vetted app ideas that used GPT models in meaningful, practical ways. No gimmicks, just solid use cases.

I made it because I saw the same problem over and over again: people wanted to build with GPT, but didn't know where to start. The response was great. People liked the ideas. Some even built with them. But the more feedback I got, the more I realised something important.

I'd built a resource.

But what people needed was a platform.

## From a mardown file to SaaS product

The original bundles were static. You downloaded a list, maybe with a PRD and took it from there. But here's the thing, builders don't want a list. They want a personalised launchpad. They want to plug in what they care about and get back something that makes sense for *them*. Especially for those that are pretty unsure as to the direction they're going in the first place!

So I started iterating. What if you could go from "I want to build something" to "Here's a validated app idea, full spec, roadmap and monetisation strategy" in under five minutes?

That's what the new version of GPT Wrapper Apps does.

## What it's become

GPT Wrapper Apps is now a fully-fledged SaaS platform. You log in, tell it about your passions, skills and goals and it gives you personalised, AI-powered app ideas backed by:

- Competitive analysis
- Ease-of-build scores
- Suggested tech stack
- Detailed Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
- Monetisation paths
- Go-to-market plans

It's all streamable in real-time. No more blank pages. No more idea paralysis. Just actionable outputs you can take and run with.

## Who it's for

I didn't build this for VC-backed startups chasing unicorns, although that would be cool if one of the ideas ended up as that!

I built it for indie makers, AI tinkerers, solo devs, bootcamp grads and small agencies who just want to build something useful and make it real. People like us don't need fluff. We need clarity and momentum.

## Why I made the leap

Honestly? Because static bundles were only scratching the surface. People wanted more. They wanted a system that grew with them, that adapted to their level and helped them focus on execution.

I realised I was sitting on something way more valuable than a list of ideas. So I reworked the whole thing from the ground up.

- Full onboarding flow to tailor ideas to you
- Real-time generation with proper market intelligence
- Exportable PRDs you can paste straight into Cursor or Replit
- Built with a full modern stack: Next.js, Supabase, Clerk, LemonSqueezy

It's scrappy but powerful. Lean but serious. And it's just getting started.

## What's coming next

Here's what I'm working on next:

I've built out a 2month roadmap of features that I'd like to take a look at, but also actively receiving feedback to interate this even further. 

## Final thoughts

If you tried the early bundles — thank you. That was the seed. This is the garden.

The new GPT Wrapper Apps is live and growing. If you've ever sat staring at a blank screen thinking "I want to build something, but what?", this might be your next favourite tool.
