## THE PROBLEM

Iâ€™ve always had an issue with local news sites. Too many ads. Broken layouts. Pop-ups. Clutter everywhere. You just want to read a simple article and instead it feels like youâ€™re navigating a minefield.

So I built something.

It started as an experiment. One of those "I wonder if I can..." moments. Iâ€™d been vibe coding more recently and this felt like a good challenge. Could I make reading news actually enjoyable again?

## THE APPROACH

Reading online used to be easier. Now itâ€™s a mess. Pages are built for revenue, not readability. But when you care about the words on the page, about learning or just staying informed, that gets frustrating fast.

I didnâ€™t want to block everything. I just wanted a better way to focus. So thatâ€™s what CleanReader does. It gives you:

- A clear layout with professional typography
- Light and dark mode that remembers your preference
- Full article detection using Mozillaâ€™s Readability.js
- Support for thousands of sites including news, blogs and academic publications
- All content processed locally with no tracking or data collection

## WHY NOW

Iâ€™d been on a run of shipping small products and this one felt personal. I made it for me. For friends who read a lot. For people who still value written content and want to actually enjoy the experience.

Itâ€™s privacy-focused, fast and just works. And honestly, itâ€™s the kind of thing I wish existed years ago.

## WANT TO TRY IT?

If you read online and want something that makes that experience better, give CleanReader a go. Itâ€™s a little thing. But it might make your reading time a lot better.
