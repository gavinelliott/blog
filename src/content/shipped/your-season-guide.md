## THE PROBLEM

For years, seasonal color analysis was either locked behind expensive consultations, facebook community groups or buried inside untrustworthy online quizzes. Most digital tools offered little more than generic advice or poorly designed interfaces that made the whole process feel unapproachable and outdated.

I wanted to fix that. I wanted to build something beautiful, personal and technically modern. A tool that could guide users toward discovering their best colours, whether through a simple set of selections or a photo-based analysis. Something that felt like a real service, not just a quiz.

And I wanted to do it all myself (for my partner).

## THE APPROACH

Your Season Guide was an experiment in bringing together two things I care about — design and making something real. I wanted to keep it simple on the surface but powerful underneath, building a fully featured product with a clear, focused purpose.

The product includes two core flows:

### Free Manual Colour Analysis

Users can select their skin tone, hair and eye colour. From there, an algorithm determines their seasonal type — Winter, Spring, Summer or Autumn — and provides a tailored palette and seasonal characteristics.

### Premium Photo Analysis

For a small one-time fee, users can upload a photo to receive an enhanced report. This includes shade variations, colour harmonies, styling tips and colours to avoid. It's a more personalised and detailed approach for those who want to go deeper.

The app includes full authentication and user management via Clerk, Stripe integration for subscriptions and payments, Resend for emails and Supabase for database storage. Everything's built with modern tools — TypeScript, Next.js 14, Drizzle ORM and a healthy dose of Tailwind CSS.

### Key Features

- Colour palette generation
- Premium unlock and payment flow
- Camera access for photo uploads
- Shareable, downloadable results
- Full dashboard and user account management
- Blog and rich content CMS via Sanity

What made this fun was the fact I could iterate fast. Build something real. Test the flow. Tweak the wording. Add subtle animations. It all came together quickly and cleanly, and the results speak for themselves.

## WHAT I LEARNED

**Your Season Guide** is now live and serving users. It's a calm, elegant tool in a space that's usually loud and awkward. It's private, quick and beautifully responsive. I built it with a goal of learning, launching and improving.

And most importantly, it made it real.
