## Project Overview

This case study outlines my work leading a cross-disciplinary design team on a critical government service. The project aimed to simplify the complex application process used by millions of citizens, improving accessibility and reducing completion time.

## Challenge

When I joined the project, the service had several critical issues:

- Completion rates were below 60%
- Users reported confusion with terminology and process flow
- The service wasn't meeting accessibility requirements
- Mobile users struggled with complex form inputs
- Content was written in complex language (reading age 16+)

The team needed to redesign the service while working within strict government guidelines and maintaining existing backend systems.

## Approach

### Discovery Phase

I began by establishing a comprehensive research plan to understand user needs:

- Conducted 25+ user interviews with diverse participants
- Analyzed existing analytics and drop-off points
- Created journey maps highlighting pain points
- Established baseline metrics for improvement

### Design Process

I implemented a user-centered design process:

1. **Problem Definition**: Created clear problem statements based on user research
2. **Design Exploration**: Facilitated workshops to generate multiple solution approaches
3. **Prototyping**: Developed low and high-fidelity prototypes
4. **User Testing**: Conducted iterative testing with real users
5. **Refinement**: Continuously improved designs based on feedback

### Team Leadership

As Head of Design, I:

- Led a team of 6 designers (interaction, content, service)
- Established clear design principles aligned with GDS standards
- Created a component library for consistency
- Facilitated collaboration between design, product and development
- Advocated for user needs throughout the process

## Results

The redesigned service launched with significant improvements:

- Completion rates increased to 88%
- Average completion time reduced by 40%
- Accessibility score improved to AAA compliance
- User satisfaction scores increased from 3.2/5 to 4.7/5
- Mobile usage increased by 35%

## Key Learnings

This project reinforced several important principles:

- **Start with user needs**: Always base decisions on research and evidence
- **Iterative improvement**: Small, frequent changes based on feedback yield better results
- **Cross-functional collaboration**: Breaking down silos between design, content and development creates better outcomes
- **Design for inclusivity**: Designing for edge cases improves the experience for everyone

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated how thoughtful, user-centered design can transform government services. By focusing on simplicity, accessibility, and user needs, we created a service that better serves citizens while meeting organizational objectives.
