A design leader who focuses on solving complex problems in simple ways. I'm the Head of Interaction and Service Design in DWP Digital, part of the largest UK Government Department. I spend the majority of my time on embedding good user-centred design and building the capability of our designers in the organisation. The services we provide are relied upon by over 20 million people. On the side, I speak regularly about Impostor Syndrome, designing good services and professional progression. I also mentor and coach designers for 1 year slots.

## ðŸ‘† Wait, what happens when I click that button?

Good question. Here's what it will do...

1. Netlify will clone the [git repository]({{pkg.repository.url}}) of this project into your GitHub account. You will be asked for the required permissions to add the repo for you.
2. They'll create a new site for you in Netlify, and configure it to use your shiny new repo. Right away you'll be able to deploy changes simply by pushing changes to your repo.
3. That's it really.
