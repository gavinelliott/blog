#### Talk Description

When impostor syndrome got to be too much for Gavin Elliott, he had to confront his own deep, sophisticated mental health challenges. In a personal talk, Gavin shares how he learned to handle anxiety and imposter syndrome in a society that’s uncomfortable discussing it. As he says: “Being honest about how we feel doesn’t make us weak — we can overcome our impostor.”

This talk will discuss mental health support, recognising impostor syndrome, the effect it has on our personal and professional lives, how to deal with it and ultimately overcome your impostor.
