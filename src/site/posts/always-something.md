title: There's always something

In the last 4 roles I've held, within the first few months of joining something has happened that would cause a tectonic movement beneath my feet.

A role I joined in 2013 had its first CEO change in the weeks after I joined, the second CEO change within 3-6 months and another within 6-9 months.

The next role was at DWP and within a week or two Mike Bracken, Tom Loosemore and Ben Terrett left GDS, who had been the custodians of how we'd change the world in UK Gov at the time. I can still remember the day [@benholliday](https://twitter.com/benholliday) told me that it'd be ok and "Please don't leave".

Funny thing being that just a few years later, and years of Ben becoming a friend as much as my manager, he then [decided to leave](https://gavinelliott.co.uk/posts/the-day-that-ben-left/) just as I took on the role of Head of Interaction Design. Thankfully I had a gut feeling he was about to make his decision so it didn't rock the ground beneath me, however, was still a big loss.

Each time something happens you become a little more resilient to whatever may come next, you never quite know what's around the corner.

### Shopify

8 weeks ago [I joined Shopify](https://gavinelliott.co.uk/posts/the-one-that-didnt-get-away/).

This week, we were notified of [changes to Shopify's team](https://news.shopify.com/changes-to-shopifys-team).

If you're hiring, check LinkedIn or twitter with the #shopify tag. You'll find some of the most talented professionals you could come across. Shopify's hiring process makes sure it hires the best.

Needless to say, being 8 weeks in, the news came as a shock. As a leader I had to draw on all of the previous occasions where something wild has happened to support the team through it.  

### There's always something

Something always seems to happen. My spiritual side tells me it's a test to check on my resilience or it might just be a fluke.

Either way, there are learnings throughout them all.

Onwards.
