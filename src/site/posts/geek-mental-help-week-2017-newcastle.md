I am organising Newcastle’s first Geek Mental Help Week event. It will take place at the Mining Institute in Newcastle on 3 October 2017 at 6pm.

#### What is Geek Mental Help Week?

It is a week-long series of articles, podcasts and events about mental health issues. We’ll hear stories from those who suffer as well as those who care for us and find out how to help.

#### Why?

Mental health is still a taboo subject. It’s often thought that because we ‘work behind computers’ that our jobs are not stressful. Mental health affects everyone from all walks of life. No one is immune.

Geek Mental Help Week gives people a voice. More importantly, it starts the open communication the topic needs.

Over the past couple of months I’ve been touring the UK giving a talk on [Impostor Syndrome](http://www.gavinelliott.co.uk/talks/imposter-syndrome/) for that very reason.

#### Who will be speaking at the event?

The event is being supported by Colin Oakley, a Front-end Developer at DWP Digital in Newcastle. Colin co-organises [Frontend NE](https://frontendne.co.uk/). I’ll be hosting the event and have invited a few people to speak:

- [Craig Abbott](https://twitter.com/abbott567) – Interaction Designer at DWP Digital
- [Kelly Lothbrook-Smith](https://twitter.com/Kayelesss) – Senior UX Researcher at BBC
- [Tom Walker](https://twitter.com/WalkerUXRanger) – Design Researcher at BBC
- A representative from [North East Counselling Services](https://www.necounselling.org.uk/)

#### Register for a place

The more we talk about mental health, the more we can break down the stigma that surrounds it. By attending you can add your voice to the conversation or simply listen to what others have to say.
