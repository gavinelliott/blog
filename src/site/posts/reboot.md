It’s time.

Make no mistake, 2016 has been the [worst year ever](http://www.gavinelliott.co.uk/2016/01/hello-you-hell-you-this-is-me/) and as I write this I’m nearly half way through one of the worst weeks.

I’ve been managing to [write](https://medium.com/@gavinelliott/i-dont-know-how-to-feel-3704fc2f9f3d) [snippets](https://medium.com/@gavinelliott/loss-a923341da3ac) on Medium when I’ve felt able, but there’s been nothing of substance here for so long and I felt like I couldn’t even begin to write anymore.

So what do you do when something stalls or becomes frozen?

You switch it off and on again.

So this is the reboot, the thing you do when you want to get going again and I’ve got a lot to say.
