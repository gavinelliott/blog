### The Service Innovation Handbook: Action-oriented Creative Thinking Toolkit for Service Organizations

<img align="left" src="/images/the-service-innovation-handbook.jpg" alt="The Service Innovation Handbook Book Cover" style="width: 80px; padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">

### Articulating Design Decisions

<img align="left" src="/images/articulating-design-decisions.jpg" style="padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">

Talking to people about your designs might seem like a basic skill, but it can be difficult to do efficiently and well. And, in many cases, how you communicate about your work with stakeholders, clients, and other non-designers is more critical than the designs themselves—simply because the most articulate person usually wins.

This practical guide focuses on principles, tactics, and actionable methods for presenting your designs. Whether you design UX, websites, or products, you’ll learn how to win over anyone who has influence over the project—with the goal of creating the best experience for the end user.

### Product Design for the Web

<img align="left" src="/images/product-design-for-the-web.jpg" style="padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">Web designers are no longer just web designers. To create a successful web product that’s as large as Etsy, Facebook, Twitter, or Pinterest–or even as small as a tiny app–you need to know more than just HTML and CSS. You need to understand how to create meaningful online experiences so that users want to come back again and again.

### More Human: Designing a World Where People Come First

<img align="left" src="/images/more-human.jpg" style="padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;"> In this powerful manifesto, Steve Hilton argues that the frustrations people feel with government, politics, their economic circumstances and their daily lives are caused by deep structural problems with the systems that dominate our modern world – systems that have become too big, bureaucratic and distant from the human scale. He shows how change is possible, offering us a more human way of living.

### User Story Mapping: Discover the Whole Story, Build the Right Product

<img align="left" src="/images/user-story-mapping.jpg" style="padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;"> User story mapping is a valuable tool for software development, once you understand why and how to use it. This insightful book examines how this often misunderstood technique can help your team stay focused on users and their needs without getting lost in the enthusiasm for individual product features.

Author Jeff Patton shows you how changeable story maps enable your team to hold better conversations about the project throughout the development process. Your team will learn to come away with a shared understanding of what you’re attempting to build and why.

### Well-Designed

<img align="left" src="/images/well-designed.jpg" style="padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;"> In this refreshingly jargon-free and practical book, product design expert Jon Kolko maps out this process, demonstrating how it will help you and your team conceive and build successful, emotionally resonant products again and again.

The key, says Kolko, is empathy. You need to deeply understand customer needs and feelings, and this understanding must be reflected in the product. In successive chapters of the book, we see how leading companies use a design process of storytelling and iteration that evokes positive emotions, changes behavior, and creates deep engagement.

### The Laws of Simplicity

<img align="left" src="/images/the-laws-of-simplicity-book.jpg" alt="The Laws of Simplicity Book Cover" style="width: 80px; padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;"> Ten laws of simplicity for business, technology, and design that teach us how to need less but get more. Finally, we are learning that simplicity equals sanity. We're rebelling against technology that's too complicated, DVD players with too many menus, and software accompanied by 75-megabyte "read me" manuals. The iPod's clean gadgetry has made simplicity hip. But sometimes we find ourselves caught up in the simplicity paradox: we want something that's simple and easy to use, but also does all the complex things we might ever want it to do.

In The Laws of Simplicity, John Maeda offers ten laws for balancing simplicity and complexity in business, technology, and design-guidelines for needing less and actually getting more. Maeda-a professor in MIT's Media Lab and a world-renowned graphic designer-explores the question of how we can redefine the notion of "improved" so that it doesn't always mean something more, something added on.

### Design Meets Disability

<img align="left" src="/images/design-meets-disability.jpg" alt="Design Meets Disability Book Cover" style="width: 80px; padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;"> How design for disabled people and mainstream design could inspire, provoke, and radically change each other. Eyeglasses have been transformed from medical necessity to fashion accessory. This revolution has come about through embracing the design culture of the fashion industry. Why shouldn't design sensibilities also be applied to hearing aids, prosthetic limbs, and communication aids? In return, disability can provoke radical new directions in mainstream design. Charles and Ray Eames's iconic furniture was inspired by a molded plywood leg splint that they designed for injured and disabled servicemen. Designers today could be similarly inspired by disability.

In Design Meets Disability, Graham Pullin shows us how design and disability can inspire each other. In the Eameses' work there was a healthy tension between cut-to-the-chase problem solving and more playful explorations. Pullin offers examples of how design can meet disability today.

### Design as Politics

<img align="left" src="/images/design-as-policitics.jpg" alt="Design as Politics Book Cover" style="width: 80px; padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;"> Design as Politics confronts the inadequacy of contemporary politics to deal with un-sustainability. Current 'solutions' to unsustainability are analysed as utterly insufficient for dealing with the problems but, further than this, the book questions the very ability of democracy to deliver a sustainable future.

Design as Politics argues that finding solutions to this problem, of which climate change is only one part, demands original and radical thinking. Rather than reverting to failed political ideologies, the book proposes a post-democratic politics. In this, Design occupies a major role, not as it is but as it could be if transformed into a powerful agent of change, a force to create and extend freedom. The book does no less than position Design as a vital form of political action.

### The Non-Designer's Design Book

## <a name="management-and-leadership">Management and Leadership Books</a>

The collection of books below cover everything for you if you're an aspiring manager or leader or whether you've been doing it for a while and what to investigate different types of management and leadership.

### The Making of a Manager: What to Do When Everyone Looks to You

<img align="left" src="/images/the-making-of-a-manager.jpg" alt="The Making of a Manager" style="width: 80px; padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;"> Top tech executive Julie Zhuo remembers the moment when she was asked to lead a team. She felt like she’d won the golden ticket, until reality came crashing in. She was just 25 and had barely any experience being managed, let alone managing others.

Her co-workers became her employees overnight, and she faced a series of anxiety-inducing firsts, including agonising over whether to hire an interviewee; seeking the respect of reports who were cleverer than her; and having to fire someone she liked. Like most first-time managers, she wasn’t given any formal training, and had no resources to turn to for help. It took her years to find her way, but now she’s offering you the short-cut to success.

Whether you're new to the job, a veteran leader, or looking to be promoted, this is the handbook you need to be the kind of manager you've always wanted.

### Turn the Ship Around!

<img align="left" src="/images/turn-the-ship-around.jpg" style="padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;"> Captain David Marquet was used to giving orders. In the high-stress environment of the USS *Santa Fe,* a nuclear-powered submarine, it was crucial his men did their job well. But the ship was dogged by poor morale, poor performance and the worst retention in the fleet.

Marquet took matters into his own hands and pushed for leadership at every level. Before long, his crew became fully engaged and the *Santa Fe* skyrocketed from worst to the first in the fleet.

No matter your business or position, you can apply Marquet’s approach to create a workplace where everyone takes responsibility for their actions, people are healthier and happier – and everyone is a leader.

### American Icon

<img align="left" src="/images/american-icon.jpg" style="padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;"> At the end of 2008, Ford Motor Company was just months away from running out of cash. With the auto industry careening toward ruin, Congress offered all three Detroit automakers a bailout. General Motors and Chrysler grabbed the taxpayer lifeline, but Ford decided to save itself.

Under the leadership of charismatic CEO Alan Mulally, Ford had already put together a bold plan to unify its divided global operations, transform its lackluster product lineup, and overcome a dys-functional culture of infighting, backstabbing, and excuses. It was an extraordinary risk, but it was the only way the Ford family--America's last great industrial dynasty--could hold on to their company.

### How Google Works

<img align="left" src="/images/how-google-works.jpg" style="padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;"> Both Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg came to Google as seasoned Silicon Valley business executives, but over the course of a decade they came to see the wisdom in Coach John Wooden's observation that 'it's what you learn after you know it all that counts'. As they helped grow Google from a young start-up to a global icon, they relearned everything they knew about management. How Google Works is the sum of those experiences distilled into a fun, easy-to-read primer on corporate culture, strategy, talent, decision-making, communication, innovation, and dealing with disruption.

The authors explain how the confluence of three seismic changes - the internet, mobile, and cloud computing - has shifted the balance of power from companies to consumers. The companies that will thrive in this ever-changing landscape will be the ones that create superior products and attract a new breed of multifaceted employees whom the authors dub 'smart creatives'. The management maxims ('Consensus requires dissension', 'Exile knaves but fight for divas', 'Think 10X, not 10%') are illustrated with previously unreported anecdotes from Google's corporate history.

In Onward, he shares the remarkable story of his return and the company's ongoing transformation under his leadership, revealing how, during one of the most tumultuous economic times in history, Starbucks again achieved profitability and sustainability without sacrificing humanity.
